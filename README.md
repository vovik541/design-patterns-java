# Design Patterns in Java

Java reference implementations of classic design patterns based on Refactoring.Guru.

## Goal
Refresh and reinforce knowledge of classic design patterns through clean, minimal, and practical Java examples.

## Creational Patterns
- **Factory Method** — Defines an interface for creating objects while letting subclasses decide the implementation.
- **Abstract Factory** — Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder** — Constructs complex objects step by step while keeping the process flexible and readable.
- **Prototype** — Creates new objects by cloning existing instances.
- **Singleton** — Ensures a class has a single instance with a global access point.

## Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** — Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge** — Decouples abstraction from implementation so both can vary independently.
- **Composite** — Composes objects into tree structures and treats them uniformly.
- **Decorator** — Adds behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- **Facade** — Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight** — Minimizes memory usage by sharing common object state.
- **Proxy** — Controls access to another object.

## Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility** — Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
- **Command** — Encapsulates actions as objects.
- **Iterator** — Traverses collections without exposing internal structure.
- **Mediator** — Centralizes communication between objects.
- **Memento** — Captures and restores object state.
- **Observer** — Notifies dependent objects about state changes.
- **State** — Alters behavior when internal state changes.
- **Strategy** — Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.
- **Template Method** — Defines algorithm skeleton with customizable steps.
- **Visitor** — Adds operations to object structures without modifying them.
